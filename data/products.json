Good music quality as well, only thing that could be better is the noise canceling aspect. My old JBL earbuds had different settings, these don’t. But still great quality. And love the mint color!",

I like how the color on the case changes to show the level of charge so you know if it needs charging soon. It connects easy to my phone, and the sound quality is great. I bought a second pair because I lost my first pair and I liked these so much I didn't want to go for a different pair.",
